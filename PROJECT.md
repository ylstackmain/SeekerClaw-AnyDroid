# SeekerClaw — Project Description

> **Living document.** Update after every shipped feature. Read before any feature work.

## One-Liner

SeekerClaw turns a Solana Seeker phone into a 24/7 personal AI agent you control through Telegram.

## Elevator Pitch

SeekerClaw embeds a full Node.js runtime inside an Android app, running an OpenClaw-compatible AI gateway as a foreground service. Users interact with their agent through Telegram — the app itself is minimal (setup, status, logs, settings). The agent has 61 tools + MCP dynamic, 35 skills (20 bundled + 13 workspace + 2 user-created), ranked memory search, cron scheduling, Android device control, Solana wallet integration, and web intelligence — all running locally on the phone, 24/7. Supports both Telegram and Discord channels.

## What It Is

SeekerClaw is an Android app built for the Solana Seeker phone (also works on any Android 10+ device with 4GB+ RAM). It packages a Node.js 18 runtime via nodejs-mobile and runs an AI agent gateway derived from OpenClaw. The agent connects to Anthropic's Claude API for intelligence and to Telegram for user communication.

**Who it's for:** Seeker phone owners who want an always-on AI assistant that can manage their crypto wallet, control their phone, search the web, and automate tasks — all from Telegram.

**How it works:**
1. User installs the app, scans a QR code with API credentials
2. The app starts a foreground service running Node.js
3. Node.js runs the AI gateway, connecting to Claude + Telegram
4. User sends messages in Telegram, agent responds with tools

## Features — Shipped

### AI Agent Core
- **Claude integration** — Opus 4.7 (default), Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5 selectable. Prompt caching, retry with backoff, rate-limit throttling, user-friendly error messages. OAuth/setup token support for Claude Pro/Max users. Conversational API key setup flow.
- **Multi-provider architecture** — Provider adapter pattern (claude/openai/openrouter/custom) with unified internal message format. OpenAI Responses API support (`/v1/responses`) with SSE streaming, function_call items, vision. OpenRouter Chat Completions adapter with prompt caching, model fallbacks, error classification (401-503), vision support. Custom provider for any OpenAI-compatible gateway — user-configurable base URL, API key, custom headers, and Chat Completions or Responses API format. Provider-agnostic DB logging and usage tracking. Safe defaults — unknown provider falls back to Claude. Credential hygiene — only active provider's key written to config.json.
- **Multi-turn task execution** — Reliable P2 multi-turn: tool budget management with validation-aware restore, silent turn stop prevention on budget exhaustion, MAX_TOOL_USES=25 for complex tasks
- **API timeout hardening** — Configurable timeouts (replacing hardcoded 60s), bounded retry with backoff for timeout paths, turn-level tracing instrumentation, sanitized user-visible error messages, 429 retry jitter
- **Context token estimation + adaptive trimming** — Token-aware conversation management that estimates context size and trims oldest messages to stay within limits, preventing API failures from oversized contexts
- **Streaming + payload optimization** — Eliminates API transport timeouts via streaming responses, response field whitelisting to prevent payload bloat (_inputJson leak fix), MAX_HISTORY bumped 20→35 for richer context
- **Telegram owner gate** — Service refuses to start without valid TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID; unauthorized users get reaction + comment warning; all gate events logged at WARN level
- **MCP support** — Remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers via Streamable HTTP. Users add server URLs in Settings; agent discovers and uses tools at startup. Description sanitization, SHA-256 rug-pull detection, untrusted content wrapping, per-server + global rate limiting.
- **Telegram bot** — HTML formatting (no markdown headers), native blockquotes, bidirectional reactions, file download with vision, file upload (telegram_send_file tool), long message chunking, quoted replies via `[[reply_to_current]]`, emoji rendering fixed, companion-tone message templates (docs/internal/TEMPLATES.md), context-aware `/start`, sent message ID tracking (ring buffer, 24h TTL) + `telegram_send` tool for same-turn delete flows, contextual status messages for long-running tools (🔍 Searching..., ⚙️ Running..., etc.), inline keyboard buttons via `telegram_send` with callback query handling
- **SILENT_REPLY protocol** — Agent silently drops messages when it has nothing useful to say
- **Ephemeral session awareness** — Agent knows context resets on restart
- **PLATFORM.md auto-generation** — Device state (model, RAM, storage, battery, permissions, wallet) written on every service start
- **Setup token billing attribution** — Anthropic setup tokens (sk-ant-oat01-*) now work with Sonnet/Opus via CC_BILLING_HEADER in system prompt (BAT-460)
- **Self-awareness system prompt** — Self-knowledge doors, architecture blocks, self-diagnosis playbook for troubleshooting tool failures and silent responses. Debug log rotation at 5MB with `.old` archive. DIAGNOSTICS.md deep troubleshooting guide. SAB-AUDIT-v13: 100% score (141/141 audit points)
- **Structured log levels** — DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR pipeline with per-level routing; UI log viewer color-coded by level; LogCollector filters noise from debug output
- **Quick Actions** — `/quick` command sends Telegram inline keyboard with 6 preset one-tap buttons (Status, Portfolio, SOL Price, News Brief, My Tasks, Memory). Self-contained `quick-actions.js` module with single-source-of-truth button definitions.
- **Search provider system** — Configurable web search backend (Exa, Tavily, Firecrawl, Brave, Perplexity) with per-provider API key management in Settings. Single-provider architecture — one active at a time.
- **Skill routing** — Routing blocks prevent conflicting skills from firing together; reply tag first-token rule for reliable `[[reply_to_current]]` detection
- **Skill requirements gating** — Skills with `requires.bins` or `requires.env` in YAML frontmatter are checked at runtime; unmet requirements are reported and skill is skipped
- **Skill Marketplace** (v1.11.0, 2026-05-17) — Live community marketplace integrated into the Skills screen. Users can search configured skill catalogs (ClawHub by default) for new skills and install them with one tap. Skill Source URLs are manageable in Settings. Agent also has the `skill_marketplace_search` tool to discover skills. Users can create skill templates or paste-import raw SKILL.md content directly from the app.
- **Env Vars** (v1.9.1, 2026-04-17) — user-managed env var store in Settings. Feeds `process.env` on Node side. Skill `requires.env` gates now work out of the box. New `env_list` tool exposes key names only to the agent (never values). Skills screen shows red-dot for missing envs with one-tap add flow. Raw editor for round-trip bulk edit with added/modified/removed/invalid diff preview.

### Telegram Commands
| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/start` | Welcome message |
| `/help` | List available commands |
| `/status` | System status |
| `/new` | Save summary, clear conversation |
| `/reset` | Clear conversation (no summary) |
| `/soul` | Show personality |

| `/skills` | List installed skills |
| `/version` | Show app/OpenClaw/Node versions |
| `/logs` | Show recent debug log entries |
| `/approve` | Approve pending confirmation |
| `/deny` | Deny pending confirmation |

### Skills (20 bundled + 13 workspace, version-aware seeding)
**Bundled skills (OpenClaw format, seeded by ConfigManager.kt with SHA-256 integrity + version tracking):** bookmark, briefing, calclaw (AI calorie tracker), calculator, crypto-prices, define, github, joke, movie-tv, netwatch (network monitoring & security audit), news, notes, quote, reminders, research, summarize, timer, todo, translate, weather
**Workspace skills (agent-usable examples):** crypto-prices, device-status, dictionary, exchange-rates, github, location, movie-tv, phone-call, recipe, sms, solana-dapp, solana-wallet, speak
**Skill format:** YAML frontmatter (name, description, version, emoji, requires) — see `SKILL-FORMAT.md`
**Skill install** — `skill_install` tool to install skills from URL or Telegram file attachment, with diagnostics via `/skills` command
**Skill export/import** — Export individual skills as .md or bulk export user-added skills as ZIP; import from ZIP or .md file with path traversal protection, bundled skill overwrite prevention, size caps, and rollback on failure
**Skill images & labels** — Skills support `image` URL field (loaded via Coil), grouped into "Added" and "Default" sections, SHA-256 hash comparison detects modified defaults
**Auto-cleanup** — Empty skill directories removed automatically after file deletion

### Security
- **Prompt injection defense** — Content Trust Policy in system prompt, `<<<EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT>>>` boundary markers on all web_fetch/web_search results, 10-pattern suspicious content detection, Unicode homoglyph sanitization, zero-width space normalization
- **Skill file protection** — Writes/edits to `skills/` blocked when suspicious injection patterns detected in content
- **Tool confirmation gates** — `android_sms`, `android_call`, `solana_send`, `solana_swap`, `jupiter_trigger_create`, `jupiter_dca_create` require explicit user YES via Telegram before execution. 60s timeout auto-cancels. Rate limited (SMS/call 1 per 60s, Solana 1 per 15s, Jupiter 1 per 30s)
- **Jupiter API hardening** — 7 fixes from official skill audit (BAT-151-157): no retry for non-idempotent POSTs, amount validation, slippage bounds, error message sanitization
- **Secrets blocklist** — `config.json`, `config.yaml`, `seekerclaw.db` blocked from `read` tool (with symlink resolution) and `js_eval` fs access (proxied `fs`/`fs.promises` modules)
- **ALT-safe swap verification** — `verifySwapTransaction()` rejects instructions referencing programs via Address Lookup Tables (prevents drainer bypass)
- **js_eval sandbox** — blocked modules (child_process, vm, etc.), restricted fs (read/write/copy guards on sensitive files), shadowed `process`/`global`/`globalThis`
- API key redaction in logs
- Path traversal prevention (workspace sandboxing)
- Shell command allowlist (no rm, kill, etc.)
- Bridge token authentication
- Swap transaction verification (checks payer, programs, signers)

### Channels
- **Telegram** — Primary channel. HTML formatting, reactions, file sharing, vision, inline keyboards, bot commands.
- **Discord** — Gateway v10 WebSocket, channel abstraction (`channel.js`), message formatting adapted for Discord markdown. Seeded via `channel` field in `config.yaml`. Full feature parity with Telegram (tools, confirmations, reactions via message edits).
- **Channel abstraction** — `channel.js` module provides a unified `sendMessage()`/`sendTyping()`/`sendReaction()` interface. Adding a new channel requires only a new adapter module — core agent logic is channel-agnostic.

### App (Android)
- **Live cross-process state** — Provider/authType/model (BAT-513), MCP servers (BAT-514), and agent name + search provider (BAT-515) all live in CrossProcessStore-backed JSON files (`runtime_state.json`, `mcp_servers.json`, `agent_preferences.json`). Settings UI and `:node` see each other's writes without a service restart. Atomic-rollback in `saveConfig` keeps prefs and the cross-process files convergent on FS failure.
- **Single theme** — DarkOps (dark navy + crimson red + green status), 12dp corners
- **Setup wizard** — QR scan or manual API key entry, OAuth/setup token support, haptic feedback
- **Dashboard** — Status with pulse animation (running) + dimming (stopped), uptime, message stats, active uplinks, mini terminal, API health monitoring (green/amber/red), dismissible error/network banners, deploy button disabled state when config incomplete
- **Logs viewer** — Color-coded, auto-scrolling monospace, stable keys for performance
- **Settings** — Collapsible sections with animation, grouped Anthropic & Telegram settings, edit config with masked fields, required field indicators (*), model dropdown, auto-start, battery optimization, export/import (allowlist-based, size-capped, auto-backup before import), wallet copy button, MCP server management (add/edit/remove/toggle), Skill Sources management (add/edit/remove/enable catalog URLs), visual escalation for danger zone, semantic action colors (green positive, red danger), accessibility content descriptions on all icons, permission revoke dialog on granted toggles
- **Skills tab** — Installed skills list with search, skill detail view with export button, marketplace teaser, skill images (Coil), "Added"/"Default" grouping, bulk export/import (ZIP + .md), create skill template, paste-import from raw markdown
- **System screen** — API usage stats, memory index status, Material Design polish with M3 spacing tokens
- **Foreground service** — START_STICKY with wake lock, boot receiver, watchdog (30s health check), heartbeat end-to-end probe
- **Open-source ready** — MIT license, CONTRIBUTING.md, issue/PR templates, GitHub Actions CI + release workflows.
- **Unified Release Pipeline** — Automates signed APK/AAB builds for both `main` branch and version tags.
- **Community Signing** — No-secrets-required signing flow using a public community keystore (`app/community-release.jks`) as a fallback when private secrets are missing.
- **Unified Application ID** — Both `dappStore` and `googlePlay` flavors use the same Application ID (`com.seekerclaw.app`) for consistency across distributions.
- **Firebase Analytics** build-optional — build succeeds without google-services.json.

## Limitations & Known Issues

- **Node 18 only** — nodejs-mobile doesn't support Node 22+, so `node:sqlite` is unavailable (using SQL.js WASM instead)
- **No vector embeddings** — Semantic memory search not possible yet (keyword search only)
- **OEM battery killers** — Xiaomi MIUI, Samsung OneUI may aggressively kill the background service; Seeker's stock Android avoids this
- **No browser/screen/canvas skills** — Can't be ported from OpenClaw (requires desktop environment)
- **Ephemeral context** — Conversation history resets on Node.js restart (mitigated by session summaries)
- **Two channels** — Telegram and Discord supported; WhatsApp and others not yet implemented
- **dApp Store live** — Available on Solana dApp Store (v1.4.3)
- **No light theme** — Dark only (DarkOps single theme)
